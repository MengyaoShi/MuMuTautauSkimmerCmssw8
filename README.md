# MuMuTauTauSkimmer

This Skimmer do basically job to skim down dataset of Drell-Yan background to what we are interested. tauSelectionSkim_MC.py is the corresponding

python file.

More contributions are needed from Jet Cleaning to drop all the tau related information in the old dataset, and add cleaned jets to create new dataset.

DrellYan.txt in the main folder is what provides you where our background dataset is from.

Good luck!
